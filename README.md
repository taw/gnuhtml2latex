gnuhtml2latex
=============

A Perl script that converts HTML files to LaTeX

Note
====

This is of purely historical interest.
It was written as replacement for html2latex utility in Debian nonfree repository.
I don't expect anybody to find much use for it now, especially not with the fancy HTML+CSS
people tend to write these days, but then one never knows.
